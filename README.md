# Gene Expression Programming (GEP) in Go

This is an independent implementation of the Gene Expression Programming (GEP)
machine learning algorithm created by Dr. CÃ¢ndida Ferreira.
It was written in the Go programming language by Glenn Lewis (gmlewis@google.com).

For more information, please visit http://www.gepsoft.com/

Here is a concise summary of GEP:

The definitive book about GEP is available here:

This is not an official Google product.

## Status

I've decided to update this repo using Go with generics (1.18+).
It is still very experimental.

# NAND Function Experiment

To build and run this code, it may help to understand this presentation,
specifically about Go workspaces: http://talks.golang.org/2012/tutorial.slide#9

To run the NAND gate GEP experiment:

```
$ go run github.com/gmlewis/gep/v2/experiments/nand
Stopping after generation #0

// gepModel is auto-generated Go source code for the
// nand solution karva expression:
// "Not.And.Or.And.Or.And.d1.d0.d1.d1.d0.d0.d1.d1.d0", score=1000
package gepModel

func gepModel(d []bool) bool {
	y := false

	y = (!(((d[1] || d[1]) || (d[0] && d[0])) && (d[1] && d[0])))

	return y
}
```

# Symbolic Regression Experiment

To run the Symbolic Regression experiment:

```
$ go run github.com/gmlewis/gep/v2/experiments/symbolic_regression
Stopping after generation #86

// gepModel is auto-generated Go source code for the
// (a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + a) solution karva expression:
// "*.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.*.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0|+|*.*.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.*.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0|+|d0.d0.d0.*.*.d0.*.*.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0|+|*.*.*.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0.d0", score=11965.591435001414
package gepModel

import (
	"math"
)

func gepModel(d []float64) float64 {
	y := 0.0

	y = (d[0] * d[0])
	y += ((d[0] * d[0]) * d[0])
	y += d[0]
	y += ((d[0] * d[0]) * (d[0] * d[0]))

	return y
}
```

# Unit Tests

To run unit tests, type:

```
$ go test github.com/gmlewis/gep/v2/...
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Grammars

While converting the C++ grammars to Go grammars, it was useful to load
in the XML files, parse them, and then dump them out to compare input
versus output.  This helped to weed out errors.

For example:

```
$ go run github.com/gmlewis/gep/v2/experiments/load_grammars > grammars.xml
```

Enjoy!
