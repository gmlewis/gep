# Blackjack Gymnasium

This example is adapted from here:
https://gymnasium.farama.org/tutorials/training_agents/blackjack_tutorial/

The difference between this example and the one in the sibbling
`blackjack-socket` directory is that this one uses an all-Go
environment for speed.

## Installation

This example only requires Go.

## Running

To run this example, type:

```shell
time go run main.go
```
